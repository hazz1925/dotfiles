## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Setup

Make sure macOS is up to date and you have installed the [required software](#prerequisites).

Clone this repo.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/joshukraine/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
```

Read the setup script.

```sh
less ~/dotfiles/setup.sh
```

Run the setup script.

```sh
bash ~/dotfiles/setup.sh
```

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

The dotfiles assume you are running macOS with (at minimum) the following software pre-installed:

* [Git][git]
* [Homebrew][homebrew] (including [coreutils][coreutils])
* [asdf][asdf]
* [Ruby][ruby]
* [Node.js][nodejs]
* [Zsh][zsh] and/or [Fish][fish]
* [Neovim][neovim]
* [Tmux][tmux]
* [Starship][starship]

All of the above and more are included installed with my fork of [Laptop][joshuas-laptop].

## üåü New Mac Bootstrap

This is what I would do if I bought a new Mac computer today. The steps below assume you have already completed the basics like checking for software updates and logging in to iCloud.

### üíª 1. Run my fork of thoughtbot‚Äôs Laptop

It is worth noting that the Laptop script is idempotent and can be safely run multiple times to ensure a consistent baseline configuration.

&#9657; **[github.com/joshukraine/laptop][joshuas-laptop]**

I‚Äôve made the following changes to my fork of Laptop:

- Remove Heroku-related code
- Customize Homebrew bundle
- Install asdf via git instead of Homebrew

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 2. Check for Stow conflicts

The dotfiles `setup.sh` script uses [GNU Stow][gnu-stow] to symlink all the config files to your `$HOME` directory. If you already have an identically-named file/directory in `$HOME` (e.g. `~/.zshrc` leftover from installing Laptop), this will cause a conflict, and Stow will (rightly) abort with an error.

The setup script will try to detect and backup these files ahead of Stow, but it‚Äôs still a good idea to check your `$HOME` directory as well as `$HOME/.config` and `$HOME/.local/bin`.

### üìç 3. Clone and setup the dotfiles

Clone

```sh
git clone https://github.com/joshukraine/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
```

Read
```sh
less ~/dotfiles/setup.sh
```

Setup

```sh
bash ~/dotfiles/setup.sh
```

If you do encounter Stow conflicts, resolve these and run setup again. The script is idempotent, so you can run it multiple times safely.

### üåô 4. Install LunarVim

[LunarVim][lunar-vim] describes itself as *‚ÄúAn IDE layer for Neovim with sane defaults.‚Äù* I‚Äôve used it for some time now and found it to be delightful. It‚Äôs pretty stable and has made configuring Neovim much simpler.

&#9657; **[lunarvim.org/docs/installation][install-lunar-vim]**

### ‚ö°Ô∏è 5. Install Zap

[Zap][zap] describes itself as a *‚Äúminimal zsh plugin manager that does what you expect.‚Äù*

&#9657; **[zapzsh.org][zap]**

After copying/pasting the install command for Zap, be sure to add the `--keep` flag to prevent Zap from replacing you existing `.zshrc` file.

### üç∫ 6. Install remaining Homebrew packages

Review the included `Brewfile` and make desired adjustments.

```sh
less ~/Brewfile
```

Install the bundle.

```sh
brew bundle install
```

### üõ†Ô∏è 7. Complete post-install tasks

- [ ] Set up iTerm2 preferences. (see details below)
- [ ] Launch LunarVim (`lvim`) and run [`:checkhealth`][checkhealth]. Resolve errors and warnings.
- [ ] Set up [1Password CLI][1p-cli-start] for managing secrets.
- [ ] Set up [1Password SSH key management][1p-cli-ssh].
- [ ] Add personal data as needed to `*.local` files such as `~/.gitconfig.local`, `~/.laptop.local`, `~/dotfiles/local/config.fish.local`.
- [ ] If using Fish, customize your setup by running the `fish_config` command.

## Zsh or Fish?

Having used both Zsh and Fish for several years, I‚Äôve decided to keep my configs for both. One thing I particularly love about Fish is the concept of [abbreviations over aliases](https://www.sean.sh/log/when-an-alias-should-actually-be-an-abbr/). Happily, there is now [zsh-abbr][zsh-abbr] which brings this functionality to Zsh.

&#9657; **[Fish abbr docs](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/cmds/abbr.html)**

My Zsh and Fish configs mostly have functional parity:

- Same prompt (Starship)
- Same essential abbreviations and functions

### Zsh Setup

Zsh is now the default shell on macOS. However, it‚Äôs helpful to add an entry enabling the Homebrew version of Zsh (`$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/bin/zsh`) instead of the default (`/bin/zsh`) version.

1. Install Zsh from Homebrew: `$ brew install zsh`
1. Add Zsh (Homebrew version) to `/etc/shells`: `$ echo $HOMEBREW_PREFIX/bin/zsh | sudo tee -a /etc/shells`
1. Set it as your default shell: `$ chsh -s $(which zsh)`
1. Install [Zap][zap]. (Required for functional parity with Fish)
1. Restart your computer.

### Fish Setup

1. Install Fish: `$ brew install fish`
1. Add Fish to `/etc/shells`: `$ echo $HOMEBREW_PREFIX/bin/fish | sudo tee -a /etc/shells`
1. Set it as your default shell: `$ chsh -s $(which fish)`
1. Restart your terminal emulator. This will create the `~/.config` and `~/.local` directories if they don‚Äôt already exist.

## Setting up iTerm2

Thanks to a [great blog post][blog-post] by Trevor Brown, I learned that you can quickly set up iTerm2 by exporting your profile. Here are the steps.

1. Open iTerm2.
1. Select iTerm2 > Settings. (&#8984;,)
1. Under the General tab, select ‚ÄúPreferences‚Äù.
1. Check the box labeled ‚ÄúLoad preferences from a custom folder or URL:‚Äù
1. Press ‚ÄúBrowse‚Äù and navigate to `~/dotfiles/iterm/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist`.
1. Press ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù.
1. Restart iTerm2.

## My Favorite Programming Fonts

Over the years, I‚Äôve branched out to explore a variety of mono-spaced fonts, both free and premium. Here is a list of my favorites.

### Free Fonts

*Included in my `Brewfile` and installed by default via [Homebrew Cask Fonts][homebrew-cask-fonts]*

- [Fira Code][fira-code]
- [Cascadia Code][cascadia-code]
- [Victor Mono][victor-mono]
- [JetBrains Mono][jetbrains-mono]
- [Iosveka][iosevka]

### Premium Fonts

*You have to give people money if you want these.* ü§ë

- [Operator Mono][operator-mono]
- [MonoLisa][monolisa]
- [Dank Mono][dank-mono]
- [Comic Code][comic-code]

### Ligatures

I first discovered ligatures through [Fira Code][fira-code], which IMO is probably the king of programming fonts. After using Fira Code, it‚Äôs hard to go back to a sans-ligature typeface. Therefore all‚Ä† the fonts I‚Äôve included in my fave‚Äôs list *do* include ligatures, although some have more than others.

‚Ä† *Operator Mono does not include ligatures but [can be easily patched][operator-mono-lig] to add them.*

### Nerd Font Variants

I use [Devicons][devicons] in my editor, and these require patched fonts in order to display properly. For most free fonts, there are pre-patched [Nerd Font][nerd-fonts-downloads] variants that include the various glyphs and icons.

[Homebrew Cask Fonts][homebrew-cask-fonts] includes both original and Nerd Font variants. For example:

```sh
# Original font
$ brew install --cask font-fira-code

# Patched variant
$ brew install --cask font-fira-code-nerd-font
```

If using a font that does not have a patched variant (e.g. MonoLisa) iTerm2 has an option to use an alternate font for non-ASCII characters.

## A Note about Vim performance and Ruby files

I recently discovered a resolution to some significant performance issues I had been experiencing running Vim on macOS. These issues were particularly painful when editing Ruby files. I‚Äôve documented what I learned here:

&#9657; [What I‚Äôve learned about slow performance in Vim](https://gist.github.com/joshukraine/3bfff4e9b553624b09789bc02cdd0ce6)

## Identifying Sources of Slow Startup Times (Zsh)

The `.zshrc` script can be profiled by touching the file `~/.zshrc.profiler` and starting a new login shell. To see the top 20 lines that are taking the most time use the `zshrc_profiler_view`. `zshrc_profiler` parameters are number of lines to show (20) and path to profiler log file (`$TMPDIR/zshrc_profiler.${PID}log`).
